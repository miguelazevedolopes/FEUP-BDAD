## Project Description

For the development of the Project of the curricular unit "Databases", we were allowed to choose a topic on which we should develop a database.
We chose to model the Serralves museum, as it is a symbol of Porto's culture.

## Disclaimer 

This repository, and every other repository (I own) named in the format FEUP-COURSENAME on GitHub correspond to the projects I developed during my time as a student at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto.
